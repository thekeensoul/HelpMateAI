README: Generative Search System for Insurance Domain

Project Overview

This project is designed to create a robust generative search system capable of answering queries from various insurance policy documents effectively and accurately. By leveraging frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex, the system demonstrates the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the insurance domain. The provided stub notebook serves as the foundation for building this application, ensuring a structured, efficient, and consistent development process.

Features

Generative Search: Enables users to retrieve accurate answers from complex insurance documents.

Frameworks: Utilizes LangChain or LlamaIndex for seamless document indexing and query processing.

Efficiency: Focuses on a well-structured workflow with pre-defined components for rapid development and problem-solving.

Prerequisites

Programming Language: Python 3.8+

Frameworks and Libraries:

LangChain

LlamaIndex

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

OpenAI API (for language models)

Other Tools:

Jupyter Notebook

Text-based insurance documents (e.g., PDF or text files)


How to Run the Project

Load your insurance policy documents into the data/ directory in text or PDF format.

Open the stub notebook and complete the missing sections as per the guided instructions.

Execute each cell in sequence to:

Preprocess and index the documents using LangChain or LlamaIndex.

Design and implement query pipelines.

Generate accurate and context-aware answers.

Evaluate the outputs against sample queries to validate the system.

Key Components

Problem Statement:

Design a generative search system to handle complex queries from diverse insurance documents.

LangChain/LlamaIndex is chosen for their capability to integrate language models with efficient document indexing.
